# Axioms of Kolmogorov

I had first heard of Kolmogorov when I used the Kolmogorov--Smirnov statistical test for nonparametric data.

After getting my undergrad degree that I learned that the axioms that govern modern probability theory were introduced by Kolmogorov when he published the *Foundations of the Theory of Probability* in 1933.

There is a chapter in the book [The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_Tasting_Tea) called "Kolmogorov, The Man". Pretty cool stuff..

Sets are collections of distinct elements.

  Name = c("Similar", 
           "Equality, 
           sets are identical i.e. contain the same elements",
           "Intersection",
           "Union", 
           "Belongs to", 
           "Null set", 
           "Universal set", 
           "Atom, singleton", 
           "Proper subset, S is contained within A, sometimes used  S = A",
           "Subset, if S is contained within A",
           "infinitary union, generalized union, unified union",
           "infinitary intersection, generalized intersection, unified intersection cap"),

## Axioms of Kolmogorov

**Non-negativity axiom**

> For any event $A$ in our sample space, $P(A)â‰¥0$

**Unity Axiom**

> Normalization, "the assumption of unit measure", it is probability of the sample space $\Omega$ is $P(\Omega)=1$

**$\sigma$-additivity Axiom**

~~Any countable pairwise disjoint sequence (i.e. A1,A2,\...), even countably infinite sequences of events satisfies~~

$P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}P(A_{i})$

where pairwise disjoint: i.e. $A_iA_j = \varnothing$, where $i \neq j$

(countable sequence of events: $A_1,A_2,...$)

## Implied consequences of the Axioms

Demonstrating these immediate consequences illustrates the power of the third axiom, and its interaction with the remaining two axioms.

(Theorem 1.1) Probability of the empty set

(Theorem 1.2) Finite Additivity

(Theorem 1.3) "Average"

(Theorem 1.4) The complement rule

(Theorem 1.5) Monotonicity

- Corollary

(Theorem 1.6) Highschool Theorem

(Inclusion-Exclusion Principal

(Theorem 1.7) P(A) = P(AB) + P(AB\^C)

(Theorem 1.8) Continuity of Probability Function

Probability of the empty set

The complement rule

The numeric bound
