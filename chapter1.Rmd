# Sets

Sets are a collection of distinct elements

## Set Notation

Union $\cap$

$\in$ - belongs to

$\varnothing$

$\Omega$ - universal set

$\omega$ - atom, singleton

$\subset$ - proper subset, $S$ is contained within $A$, sometimes denoted even when S = A

$\subseteq$ - subset, if $S$ is contained within $A$.

## Latex Shortcuts

$\in$

$\cup$

$\bigcup$

$\cap$

$\bigcap$

$X\le A$ - belongs to,

$\ge$

$\infty$

# Sample space and events

## Set Definitions

### Subset

### Equality

Intersection, union, complement, difference, centainty, impossibility, mututal exclusivity

## Set Relations

Communicative

associative

distributive

demorgans 1st and 2nd laws

[apply generally in textbook, also identities are usually proven elementwise]

# Axioms of Kolmogorov

(1) Non-negativity, (2) Unity, (3) $\sigma$-additivity

## (1) Non-negativity axiom

For any event $A$ in our sample space, $P(A)â‰¥0$

## (2) Unity Axiom

Normalization, "the assumption of unit measure", it is probability of the sample space $\Omega$ is $P(\Omega)=1$

## (3) $\sigma$-additivity

~~Any countable pairwise disjoint sequence (i.e. A1,A2,\...), even countably infinite sequences of events satisfies~~

$P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}P(A_{i})$

where pairwise disjoint: i.e. $A_iA_j = \varnothing$, where $i \neq j$

(countable sequence of events: $A_1,A_2,...$)

# Implied consequences of the Axioms

Demonstrating these immediate consequences illustrates the power of the third axiom, and its interaction with the remaining two axioms.

## Theorem 1.1) Probability of the empty set

## Theorem 1.2) Finite Additivity

## Theorem 1.3) "Average"

## Theorem 1.4) The complement rule

## Theorem 1.5) Monotonicity

### Corollary

## Theorem 1.6) Highschool Theorem

### Inclusion-Exclusion Principal

## Theorem 1.7) P(A) = P(AB) + P(AB\^C)

## Theorem 1.8) Continuity of Probability Function

## Probability of the empty set

## The complement rule

## The numeric bound

### Booles ineqauilty
