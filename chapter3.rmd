# Conditional Probability

Conditional probability is not a theorem, nor a conjecture. It is not a lemma or a corollary. It aims to answer the question of how you should update probability based on updated evidence.

It is philosophically intuitive idea that the conditional probability $\mathbb{P}(A|B)$ gives an advantage, when knowing the occurrence of B changes the occurrence of A.

The probability of $\mathbb{P}(A|B)$ is given by the ratio of the relative frequency of the intersection of A and B and the relative frequency of B.

We can also state this as "the ratio of the probability of joint occurrence of A and B and the probability of B."

-   Conditional probability can be can be visualized when we think in terms of area....

We define conditional probability as

$$
\mathbb{P}(A|B)=\frac{\mathbb{P}(AB)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}
$$

where $\mathbb{P}(B)>0$.

-   Intersection versus joint occurrence of events: I found myself getting bogged down in set theory.

    -   Set Theory: P(AB) is the intersection of common elements between sets A and B.

    -   Joint occurrence better describes the probability that **events** are to occur.

## Conditional Probability is a Probability Measure

That is, they satisfy the same axioms that ordinary probabilities satisfy. This enables us to use the theorems that are true for probabilities for conditional probabilities as well.

[Proofs coming soon]

## Reduction of a Sample Space

It is possible to reduce a sample space e.g. from (S to B) and have a smaller set of subsets. Making it easier to calculate conditioned probabilities.

## Law of Multiplication

Understand that conditional probability represents the relation between $\mathbb{P}(A|B)$ and $\frac{\mathbb{P}(AB)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}$ where $\mathbb{P}(B) > 0$.

By simply multiplying both sides by the $\mathbb{P}(B)$, The law of multiplication demonstrates that probability of the joint occurrence of A and B is the product of the probability of B and the conditional probability of A given that B has occurred.

$$
\mathbb{P}(AB)=\mathbb{P}(A|B)\mathbb{P}(B), \text{ where } \mathbb{P}(B)>0
$$

also,

$$
\mathbb{P}(AB)=\mathbb{P}(BA)=\mathbb{P}(B|A)\mathbb{P}(A), \text{ where } \mathbb{P}(A) > 0
$$

We can also calculate the joint probability of three events by using association laws.

Generalizing these theorems stated can be extended to $n$ events to $k$ events, the resulting formula can be proved by mathematical induction.

$$
\text{If }
\mathbb{P}(A_1 A_2 A_3 …A_{n−1}) > 0 \text{,  then} 
\\ \mathbb{P}(A_1 A_2 A_3 …A_{n−1}A_n) = \mathbb{P}(A_1)P(A_2 | A_1)P(A_3 | A_1A_2)···(A_n | A_1A_2A_3 ···A_{n−1})
$$

$$
\mathbb{P}(A) = \mathbb{P}(A|B)\mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(A|B^c)\mathbb{P}(B^c)
$$

Generalized

$$
\text{If }\mathbb{P}(A_1 A_2 A_3 …A_{n−1}) \> 0 \text{,  then} 
\\ 
\mathbb{P}(A_1 A_2 A_3 …A_{n−1}A_n) = \mathbb{P}(A_1)P(A_2 \| A_1)P(A_3 \| A_1A_2)···(A_n \| A_1A_2A_3 ···A_{n−1})
$$

To generalize the theorem we define the partition of $S$

## Bayes' Formula

Bayes' Rule is a simple calculation but a big idea about beliefs. Consider that the partitioned sample space we imagine for the law of total probability.

With Bayes' Rule we are update our belief about something given that we know some other event is true or has occurred.

We want to calculated the probability of an unknown event occurring.

examining the hypothesis given evidence is true we arrive at the expression

$$ 
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} 
$$

-   $P(H|E)$ represents the probability of hypothesis $H$ given evidence $E$.
-   $P(E|H)$ denotes the probability of observing evidence $E$ given the hypothesis $H$.
-   $P(H)$ is the prior probability of hypothesis $H$
-   $P(E)$ represents the probability of observing evidence $E$.

In order to update our beliefs... we need to consider our prior knowledge $P(H)$
